While this figure encompasses a range of data platforms, a significant portion of these are increasingly AI-driven.***\n\nIn the high-stakes world of data engineering, where the pressure to build scalable, reliable, and efficient data pipelines is relentless, a new class of co-worker has arrived. Artificial intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept discussed at conferences; it is embedded in the command line, the IDE, and the very fabric of data strategy. Our investigation into the 2025 landscape reveals a clear hierarchy of AI platforms being adopted by data engineers, with a triumvirate of tools—**GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude**—leading the charge.\n\nHowever, a closer look reveals a more complex story. Adoption is not uniform. It is shaped by deep-seated generational attitudes, the unforgiving pressures of career progression, and the specialised demands of the data engineering role itself. Whilst the tools may be new, the human patterns behind their adoption are familiar, creating a fascinating new digital divide within one of technology’s most critical professions.\n\nThis week we look into which platforms are truly gaining traction amongst data professionals, moving beyond the hype to analyse how age, experience, and professional focus dictate the new AI-powered workflow.\n\n## The Data Engineer's AI Arsenal in 2025\n\nThe role of a data engineer is evolving from a builder of pipelines to an architect of intelligent data systems. This fundamental shift is reflected in their choice of AI tooling, which is now augmenting—not replacing—their core capabilities. Our analysis, supplemented by the attached research on demographic patterns, shows that data engineers are prioritising platforms that deliver tangible gains in three key areas: code development, complex problem-solving, and high-quality documentation.\n\n**1. The Code Companion: GitHub Copilot**\n\nFor the hands-on task of writing, debugging, and optimising code, **GitHub Copilot** has become the undisputed leader for technology workers, including data engineers. Its deep integration into the development environment makes it a frictionless assistant for everything from writing boilerplate PySpark jobs to translating complex SQL queries. Mid-career professionals, in particular, favour tools like Microsoft's Copilot for their seamless integration with existing enterprise workflows, prioritising proven productivity gains over more experimental platforms.\n\n**2.

The data reveals distinct patterns of adoption across generations, challenging the simplistic narrative that younger means more adept.\n\n### Millennials (26-42): The Strategic Adopters\n\nContrary to the \"AI native\" hype surrounding Gen Z, our investigation finds that Millennials have emerged as the most expert and strategic AI adopters in the professional world. A landmark 2025 McKinsey report found that **62% of millennials aged 35 to 44 reported strong expertise with AI**, the highest of any age group.\n\nAs many Millennials now occupy mid-career and management roles, their adoption is ROI-focused. They champion tools like **Microsoft Copilot** that integrate into established systems and demonstrate clear productivity benefits. They are the organisational mentors, with two-thirds of managers fielding weekly AI questions, guiding their teams towards practical and efficient AI use.\n\n### Generation Z (18-25): The AI Natives and Experimentalists\n\nGen Z engineers, who have entered the workforce with AI as a given, display a different pattern. Whilst **70% use generative AI regularly, their engagement is characterised by experimentation and a multi-platform approach, using an average of 2.3 different AI platforms**. They are comfortable with advanced prompting and use AI extensively for learning and creative exploration. For them, platforms like **ChatGPT** and **Perplexity** are not just for work; they are fundamental tools for research and skill acquisition. However, their reported expertise is lower than that of their Millennial colleagues, indicating a phase of broad exploration rather than deep, strategic implementation.\n\n### Generation X (43-58): The Cautious Professionals\n\nData engineers from Generation X approach AI with a healthy dose of professional scepticism. With **a lower adoption rate of 34%, their usage is highly targeted towards workplace applications**. They gravitate towards tools that are embedded within familiar environments, making **Microsoft Copilot** a strong favourite due to its Office integration. Their focus is on proven use cases and quality control; they need to see demonstrable value and reliability before integrating a tool into their workflow.\n\n### Baby Boomers (59+): The Selective Users\n\nAmongst senior data engineers and leaders from the Baby Boomer generation, adoption is much lower, with around **80% having not used generative AI**. When they do engage, it is often through simpler, voice-activated interfaces like Siri or Alexa for personal assistance tasks. For this demographic, trust and simplicity are paramount. Any AI tool must offer a clear, unambiguous benefit with a minimal learning curve to gain traction.\n\n## The Career Arc: Patterns of Adoption within the Profession\n\nA data engineer's seniority directly shapes their AI engagement, shifting from task-based automation at the junior end to strategic governance at the senior level.\n\n### Entry-Level Engineers (0-3 years)\n\nFor those just starting their careers, AI is proving to be a critical tool for learning and survival. Facing a job market where executives openly consider replacing entry-level roles with AI, these engineers are **using platforms for skill development, resume writing, and automating routine tasks.** Their usage is learning-focused, relying on general-purpose AI to bridge knowledge gaps and accelerate their contribution.\n\n### Mid-Career Professionals (4-15 years)\n\nThis cohort represents the engine room of AI adoption. With a higher adoption rate than their senior colleagues (17% vs. 13% for those over 50), they are laser-focused on productivity. An overwhelming **85% report improved efficiency from using AI tools**. They are the ones implementing AI solutions for their teams, using it for complex problem-solving, data analysis, and project management. Their tool choices are pragmatic, favouring platforms that enhance their ability to deliver results.\n\n### Senior Professionals (15+ years)\n\nFor principal engineers and engineering leaders, AI presents a different set of challenges and opportunities. Their engagement shifts from hands-on use to strategic oversight, focusing on **AI governance, quality control, and compliance.** They are grappling with the organisational tension AI can create and are concerned with maintaining authority and accuracy. For this group, AI is less a personal productivity tool and more a powerful, and potentially disruptive, force that needs to be managed strategically.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9f95720b-7117-41e7-97c0-a3e3a2720eec/Data_Radio_Show_2024.gif?t=1733360882)\n\nSubscribe to the Data Radio Show\n\n## A Profession Apart: Data Engineering Adoption is Unique\n\nCompared to other professions, data engineers have a distinct relationship with AI. Unlike legal professionals, whose adoption has been historically low (0.9% of Claude usage) due to accuracy and regulatory fears, or healthcare professionals who focus on specialised diagnostic tools, data engineers are embracing a broad suite of platforms that mirror their multifaceted role.\n\nTheir adoption rates are amongst the highest, driven by the nature of their work. The need for data processing, system design, and constant innovation makes them prime candidates for AI augmentation. This is reflected in the high concentration of AI usage within technology-focused roles. The pressure is immense, but so is the opportunity. As AI reshapes workflows, data engineers are moving from task execution to strategic enablement, playing a greater role in designing the intelligent infrastructure that will power the businesses of tomorrow. The effective adoption of the right AI platforms is no longer a competitive advantage—it is the baseline for survival and success in 2025.\n\n##### That’s a wrap for this week\n\n##### Happy Engineering Data Pro’s\n\n![Data & AI Engineering news, views and careers](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/publication/logo/cfa14156-c830-47ab-9b2e-222adfc07fc2/thumb_YouTube.png)\n\ndatapro.news\n\ndatapro.news\n\nData & AI Engineering news, views and careers\n\nHome\n\nPosts\n\n© 2025 datapro.news.\n\nPrivacy policy\n\nTerms of use"

Get matched in 48 hours with vetted talent from Index.dev!**](https://www.index.dev/hire)\n\n**Key AI Agents Statistics at a Glance**\n----------------------------------------\n\n*   **Adoption is real and growing fast:** 78% of organizations are already using AI in some form, and 85% have adopted agents in at least one workflow.\n*   **The agent stack is layered and modular:** It includes LLMs, frameworks, orchestration tools, developer platforms, and control systems.\n*   **Usage is widespread across functions:** From coding to content generation, scheduling to support, agents are enhancing productivity and efficiency.\n*   **Human trust and oversight matter:** Most users prefer a human-in-the-loop setup, especially when agents take high-stakes actions.\n*   **The market is expanding rapidly:** From $3.7B in 2023 to $7.38B in 2025 and over $100B by 2032, the economic potential is massive.\n*   **Agent autonomy is increasing:** Systems are moving from task execution to goal-driven behaviour with memory, reasoning, and retry capabilities.\n*   **The future is stackable, composable, and agentic:** Companies will increasingly build their own workflows using agents as core units.\n\n**What Is the AI Agent Stack?**\n-------------------------------\n\nThe AI Agent Stack is a structured system of tools, platforms, and governance layers that work together to help teams complete tasks faster using autonomous or semi-autonomous software agents. These agents can write code, summarize content, build workflows, and interact with software or people, often with minimal human input.\n\nThis stack is not one product. It is made up of four main layers:\n\n1.   **Developer Layer:** Tools that assist in coding, debugging, and deployment.\n2.   **Knowledge Worker Layer:** Agents that help with writing, research, summarization, and reporting.\n3.   **Workflow Layer:**Platforms that allow automation across apps and departments using agent-based actions.\n4.   **Control Layer:**Systems that apply guardrails, human oversight, and access controls to ensure safe use.\n\nEach layer plays a specific role. For example, 64% of current AI agent use cases involve business process automation, while another large segment focuses on developer productivity and knowledge management.\n\n![Image 2: AI agents use case distribution, 2025](https://dx1ienyxpbg1x.cloudfront.net/index_dev/articles/gallery_images/1754548802718056934_0_50%20AI%20Agent%20Stats%20&%20Trends%20Transforming%20Work%20in%202025_blog%20image_1.png)\nThese tools work together in real time. One agent may write code, another may run a test, and a third may log the result into a report. This is what makes the AI Agent Stack powerful — it enables connected work with minimal friction.\n\nOrganizations that adopt agent stacks do not rely on a single vendor. They use a combination of tools for different tasks. This approach is why 51% of companies use two or more methods to manage AI agents, including human approval, access controls, and monitoring.\n\nIn short, the AI Agent Stack is a practical way to integrate AI across teams, tools, and tasks, making work faster, more accurate, and more scalable.\n\n**The Developer Layer: Boosting Productivity and Code Quality**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe developer layer of the AI Agent Stack includes tools that help engineers write, debug, test, and deploy code faster. These agents reduce manual tasks and improve accuracy, especially in repetitive or time-consuming areas like documentation, boilerplate generation, and bug detection.\n\nThis layer is widely adopted in engineering teams. For example:\n\n*   GitHub Copilot has over 15 million users worldwide, making it one of the most used AI coding tools.\n*   230,000 organizations use Copilot for Business, which includes features like code suggestions, security scanning, and team policies.\n*   Coding speed can increase by 126% when using AI-powered developer tools, based on benchmark testing.\n*   A Cornell study found a 15% productivity gain among engineers using AI pair programming assistants.\n*   More than 55% of developers report efficiency improvements when using AI agents during build and test phases.\n*   41% of engineers now use AI tools for documentation generation, reducing time spent on non-coding tasks.\n\nThese agents are typically integrated into the IDE or development environment. Some tools offer natural language interfaces, allowing developers to give instructions like “write a unit test for this function” or “refactor this block using async methods.”\n\nBeyond writing code, AI agents are also being used for:\n\n*   Code reviews and bug detection during pull request cycles\n*   Testing automation using smart scripts or generated test cases\n*   Deployment optimization, especially in CI/CD pipelines\n\nAs AI tools become standard in engineering workflows, companies are also adjusting hiring requirements. Recruiters are now looking for developers who are comfortable working alongside AI tools and know how to prompt agents for better outputs.\n\nThis layer sets the foundation of the AI Agent Stack by improving build velocity, team output, and software quality, all critical to modern product development.\n\n_**Explore**_[_**6 top AI tools**_](https://www.index.dev/blog/best-ai-tools-for-coding-documentation)_**for coding documentation.**_\n\n**The Knowledge Worker Layer: Enhancing Everyday Tasks**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe knowledge worker layer includes AI agents that support non-technical users in performing common business tasks, like writing, summarizing, planning, reporting, and communication. These agents are often used in tools like word processors, email clients, spreadsheets, and CRMs.\n\nThis layer has seen strong adoption across roles such as marketing, HR, operations, and finance.\n\n*   58% of organizations use AI agents for summarizing emails, documents, and meetings.\n*   64% apply AI agents for automating repetitive business workflows, such as follow-ups, updates, and internal reports.\n*   44% of consumers say they would prefer interacting with AI for simple service tasks, like bookings or tracking.\n*   70% of airline bookings through digital channels are now influenced or executed by AI assistants, especially chat-based agents.\n*   32% of Gen Z users are comfortable using AI to make online purchases or decisions.\n*   27% of users review AI-generated output before taking action, showing a shift toward agent-assisted, not agent-led, decision-making.\n\nPopular tools in this layer include:\n\n*   AI writing assistants that generate or rewrite emails\n*   Spreadsheet agents that help with data formulas and summaries\n*   CRM assistants that follow up with leads or schedule meetings\n\nThis layer makes AI available to wider business teams, even if they have no technical background. With simple prompts or clicks, users can offload time-consuming tasks to an agent, allowing them to focus on higher-priority work.\n\nAI agents in this layer are now considered productivity defaults in many enterprise software platforms. Adoption is expected to grow as companies expand usage across departments.\n\n**The Workflow Layer: Automating Multi-Step Business Processes**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe workflow layer of the AI Agent Stack connects tools and tasks across different departments. These agents can complete multi-step actions across platforms like updating CRMs, sending emails, generating reports, and scheduling events based on goals, triggers, or user inputs.\n\nThis layer is especially useful in operations, support, and admin-heavy functions where repeatable processes exist.\n\nKey adoption insights:\n\n*   Workflow automation is the top use case in 64% of agent deployments, especially in customer support, HR, and sales ops.\n*   35% of organizations using AI agents have reported cost savings through automation.\n\n![Image 3: AI agents adoption: cost savings vs in-house restrictions, 2025](https://dx1ienyxpbg1x.cloudfront.net/index_dev/articles/gallery_images/1754548875447708784_1_50%20AI%20Agent%20Stats%20&%20Trends%20Transforming%20Work%20in%202025_blog%20image_2.png)\n*   11% of companies restrict agent use to in-house systems only, due to data sensitivity concerns.\n*   88% of executives said they are either exploring or scaling agent-led workflows inside their operations.\n*   51% of companies use more than one method to control agent workflows, including role-based access, human review, and input/output validation.\n*   29% of organizations require oversight or audit logs before agents can perform key actions in workflows.\n\nAgents in this layer are often connected to platforms like:\n\n*   Zapier or Make (for logic-based task chains)\n*   Slack, MS Teams, or email (for agent-user interactions)\n*   HubSpot, Salesforce, or Monday.com (for CRM and workflow automation)\n\nThey work by chaining tasks. For example, an agent could read a support ticket, summarize it, update the helpdesk status, notify a manager, and close the loop with a response, without human intervention.\n\nThis layer is driving efficiency and consistency in business operations. As more systems offer APIs and AI integrations, the workflow layer is becoming a core part of how companies scale without increasing headcount.\n\n**The Control Layer: Keeping AI Agents Use Safe and Accountable**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe control layer is what makes the AI Agent Stack reliable at scale. It includes tools and policies that monitor, restrict, and validate agent behaviour. This layer ensures that agents work within set boundaries, especially when they handle sensitive data, perform critical tasks, or interact with customers.\n\nAs AI agents become more autonomous, companies are increasing their focus on safety, transparency, and compliance.\n\nKey data from enterprise adoption trends:\n\n*   31% of organizations do not allow AI agents to access sensitive or confidential data.\n*   29% of companies require oversight mechanisms, such as human validation, logs, or approval workflows.\n*   11% operate their agents in closed systems, only avoiding public APIs or third-party integrations.\n*   71% of employees say they prefer that AI-generated content be reviewed by a human before use.\n*   27% of all AI agent outputs are subject to manual review or sign-off before action.\n\nThe control layer often includes:\n\n*   **Role-based access:** Only certain users or teams can launch or edit agent workflows.\n*   **Input/output filtering:** Ensures agents don’t process or return unsafe or restricted content.\n*   **Audit logs:** Track what the agent did, when, and what data was involved.\n*   **Trust levels:** Different agents may have different permissions based on their reliability.\n\nAs AI tools integrate deeper into critical systems, this layer becomes essential, not just for safety, but also for meeting compliance standards across regions and industries.\n\nThe control layer doesn’t slow down automation; it makes it sustainable and trustworthy.\n\n**Enterprise Adoption Trends: How Companies Are Using AI Agents Today**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAI agents are being adopted at scale across companies of all sizes. From automating basic workflows to assisting in core development tasks, these agents are becoming integral to how teams operate.\n\nHere are the current enterprise-level adoption insights:\n\n*   78% of global organizations already use some form of AI tools in daily operations.\n*   85% of those organizations say they’ve started integrating AI agents, not just passive AI features, into their workflows.\n*   88% of executives say they’re either piloting or scaling the use of autonomous agents.\n*   46% of leaders say they fear falling behind if they don’t adopt AI agent technologies quickly.\n\n![Image 4: Leaders concerned about falling behind without AI agents](https://dx1ienyxpbg1x.cloudfront.net/index_dev/articles/gallery_images/1754549048713615985_3_50%20AI%20Agent%20Stats%20&%20Trends%20Transforming%20Work%20in%202025_blog%20image_3.png)\n*   48% of companies plan to increase hiring to support AI-led transformation, especially roles like AI operations managers and AI workflow analysts.\n*   67% of decision-makers believe agent-led tools will change existing job roles significantly within the next 2–3 years.\n*   87% agree that AI agents augment existing roles rather than replace them.\n\nAdoption is not limited to large enterprises. Mid-sized firms and startups are also deploying AI agents to remain competitive.\n\n*   SMBs are increasingly early adopters, using lightweight agents to save time and reduce overhead.\n*   Agent-led tools are now embedded in HR tech, customer support, project management, and software engineering platforms.\n\nThe adoption trend shows that what was once experimental is now enterprise-ready. Agent systems are tracked, governed, and scaled like any core tool.\n\nCompanies that invest in agent systems today are doing so with long-term goals: faster execution, better output, and workforce support.\n\n**User Behaviour and Agent Interactions: How People Use and Respond to AI Agents**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs agents become more autonomous, user trust, interaction patterns, and expectations are evolving, especially in consumer and workplace settings.\n\nUnderstanding how users interact with AI agents helps companies design better tools and experiences.

This shift toward agentic systems means agents can take initiative, make decisions, and complete multi-step tasks without constant human input.\n\nThe trend is clear across both product design and enterprise strategies.\n\nKey data points on autonomy:\n\n*   By 2029, 80% of customer service issues are expected to be resolved entirely by autonomous agents without human intervention.\n*   One-third of enterprise software tools will include agentic capabilities by 2028, enabling systems to act based on goals, not just commands.\n*   Leading vendors are building agents that can handle long-term objectives, adjust to feedback, and replan when they fail.\n*   Autonomous agents are being used for tasks like outbound sales, code refactoring, product research, and workflow management.\n\nCurrent capabilities include:\n\n*   **Multi-step reasoning:** Agents can break down a user request into smaller goals.\n*   **Self-correction:** If they fail a task, they try again or ask for help.\n*   **Memory:** They remember previous instructions or decisions to improve outcomes.\n*   **Tool use:** Agents know when and how to call APIs, databases, or functions to complete goals.\n\nThis shift to agentic behaviour demands:\n\n*   Better safety and control layers\n*   More transparent agent logs and reasoning trails\n*   Human override mechanisms when stakes are high\n\nAgent autonomy will not replace humans, but it will extend their capacity for more strategic, high-value tasks.. The role of human workers will shift toward monitoring, strategy, and feedback, while agents take on execution.\n\n**Market Size and Future Forecast**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe market for AI agents is growing fast. As adoption expands across industries and use cases, both global and segment-specific growth rates are rising.\n\nThis growth is not just about hype — it reflects real investment, enterprise usage, and product development across AI agent platforms.\n\nKey market figures:\n\n*   The global AI agent market was valued at $3.7 billion in 2023.\n*   By the end of 2025, it is projected to reach $7.38 billion, nearly doubling in just two years.\n\n![Image 6: AI agent market growth, 2023-2032](https://dx1ienyxpbg1x.cloudfront.net/index_dev/articles/gallery_images/1754549156443039916_5_50%20AI%20Agent%20Stats%20&%20Trends%20Transforming%20Work%20in%202025_blog%20image_5.png)\n*   Long-term projections show the market hitting $103.6 billion by 2032, driven by rapid enterprise adoption and new SaaS products.\n*   The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2032 is estimated at 45.3%.\n\n### **What’s driving this AI Agent growth?**\n\n*   Increased enterprise demand for AI-led automation, especially in development, customer service, and operations.\n*   The rise of AI-native startups, building platforms where agents are core features, not add-ons.\n*   New agent marketplaces offering plug-and-play solutions for specific domains — like finance, HR, legal, and marketing.\n*   Investment in agent infrastructure, including model training, orchestration layers, and control systems.\n\n### **What to expect in the next 3–5 years**\n\n*   More pre-trained agents embedded into SaaS tools.\n*   A shift toward agent marketplaces and APIs, letting companies compose their own workflows.\n*   Increased funding and M&A activity in the agent tooling ecosystem.\n*   Strong demand for talent with prompt engineering, agent design, and LLM integration skills.\n\nAs AI agents move from experimental tools to critical business infrastructure, the companies building, integrating, or hiring around this stack will define the next wave of digital transformation.\n\n**Final Words**\n---------------\n\nAI agents play a central role in how businesses operate in 2025.

AI is entering a more mature phase in 2025. Models are being refined for accuracy and efficiency, and enterprises are embedding them into everyday workflows.\n\nThe focus is shifting from what these systems could do to how they can be applied reliably and at scale. What’s emerging is a clearer picture of what it takes to build generative AI that is not just powerful, but dependable.\n\n### The new generation of LLMs\n\nLarge language models are shedding their reputation as resource-hungry giants. The cost of generating a response from a model has dropped by a factor of 1,000 over the past two years, bringing it in line with [the cost](https://cybernews.com/tech/plummeting-llm-costs-unlock-new-use-cases/) of a basic web search. That shift is making real-time AI far more viable for routine business tasks.\n\nScale with control is also this year’s priority. The leading models (Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini Flash 2.5, Grok 4, DeepSeek V3) are still large, but they’re built to respond faster, reason more clearly, and run more efficiently. Size alone is no longer the differentiator. What matters is whether a model can handle complex input, support integration, and deliver reliable outputs, even when complexity increases.\n\nLast year saw a lot of criticism of AI’s tendency to hallucinate. In one high-profile case, a New York lawyer [faced sanctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html) for citing ChatGPT-invented legal cases. Similar failures across sensitive sectors pushed the issue into the spotlight.\n\nThis is something LLM companies have been combating this year. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which combines search with generation to ground outputs in real data, has become a common approach. It helps reduce hallucinations but not eliminate them. Models can still contradict the retrieved content. New benchmarks such as RGB and RAGTruth are [being used](https://www.turing.com/resources/minimize-llm-hallucinations-strategy#how-are-llm-hallucinations-detected) to track and quantify these failures, marking a shift toward treating hallucination as a measurable engineering problem rather than an acceptable flaw.\n\n### Navigating rapid innovation\n\nOne of the defining trends of 2025 is the speed of change. Model releases are accelerating, capabilities are shifting monthly, and what counts as state-of-the-art is constantly being redefined. For enterprise leaders, this creates a knowledge gap that can quickly turn into a competitive one.\n\nStaying ahead means staying informed. Events like the [AI and Big Data Expo Europe](https://www.ai-expo.net/europe/) offer a rare chance to see where the technology is going next through real-world demos, direct conversations, and insights from those building and deploying these systems at scale.\n\n### Enterprise adoption\n\nIn 2025, the shift is toward autonomy. Many companies already use generative AI across core systems, but the focus now is on agentic AI. These are models designed to take action, not just generate content.\n\nAccording to [a recent survey](https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/insights/technology/technology-trends-2025), 78% of executives agree that digital ecosystems will need to be built for AI agents as much as for humans over the next three to five years. That expectation is shaping how platforms are designed and deployed. Here, AI is being integrated as an operator; it’s able to trigger workflows, interact with software, and handle tasks with minimal human input.\n\n### Breaking the data wall\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to progress in generative AI is data. Training large models has traditionally relied on scraping vast quantities of real-world text from the internet. But, in 2025, that well is running dry. High-quality, diverse, and ethically usable data is becoming harder to find, and more expensive to process.\n\nThis is why synthetic data is becoming a strategic asset. Rather than pulling from the web, synthetic data is generated by models to simulate realistic patterns. Until recently, it wasn’t clear whether synthetic data could support training at scale, but [research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/synthllm-breaking-the-ai-data-wall-with-scalable-synthetic-data/) from Microsoft’s SynthLLM project has confirmed that it can (if used correctly).\n\nTheir findings show that synthetic datasets can be tuned for predictable performance. Crucially, they also discovered that bigger models need less data to learn effectively; allowing teams to optimise their training approach rather than throwing resources at the problem.\n\n### Making it work\n\nGenerative AI in 2025 is growing up. Smarter LLMs, orchestrated AI agents, and scalable data strategies are now central to real-world adoption. For leaders navigating this shift, the [AI & Big Data Expo Europe](https://www.ai-expo.net/europe/) offers a clear view of how these technologies are being applied and what it takes to make them work.\n\n**See also:**[**Tencent releases versatile open-source Hunyuan AI models**](https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/tencent-releases-versatile-open-source-hunyuan-ai-models/)\n\n[![Image 4](https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ai-expo-world-728x-90-01.png)](https://www.ai-expo.net/)\n**Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?** Check out[AI & Big Data Expo](https://www.ai-expo.net/) taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

              "raw_content": "[Artificial Intelligence Channel](https://www.etftrends.com/category/artificial-intelligence-channel/) \n\n# Approaching AI Investing With a Bottom-Up Focus\n\n[Nick Wodeshick](https://www.etftrends.com/author/nickwodeshick/ \"Posts by Nick Wodeshick\")\n\nWhile some previously stable U.S. equity sectors saw some volatility due to macroeconomic uncertainty, one sector that has remained relatively steadfast is artificial intelligence.\n\nMany of the companies at the forefront of enabling AI progress, like Nvidia and Microsoft, continue to benefit as AI adoption increases.\n\nAt the same time, trade war and inflation concerns among the broader market are finally starting to ease. With companies potentially feeling more confident about macroeconomic conditions, we believe AI adoption could grow even stronger over the long term.\n\nKeeping these factors in mind, it could pay to bolster one’s portfolio with more direct exposure to AI companies, in our view. One way of getting more direct exposure is through the use of an ETF.\n\nNumerous ETFs offer a distinct focus on companies involved in artificial intelligence. However, it’s prudent for advisors and investors to do their due diligence to find the strategy that is in pole position to offer potential long-term results.\n\n## **Looking Under the Hood of ALAI**\n\nIn our view, one fund that offers a particularly interesting use case is the [Alger AI Enablers & Adopters ETF (ALAI)](https://etfdb.com/etf/alai). ALAI aims to achieve long-term growth by investing in a diversified portfolio of companies that leverage artificial intelligence. These include companies involved with the development, utilization, or adoption of AI.\n\nOne way ALAI seeks to stand apart is through its focus on bottom-up research. When it comes to selecting individual stocks, ALAI’s portfolio manager uses an intensive bottom-up process to discern which companies could be in the best position to lead the way in AI innovation. This process can help ALAI identify companies that other AI-focused ETFs may overlook.\n\nFurthermore, ALAI distinguishes itself from the competition through its active portfolio management. Many of the tried-and-tested AI ETFs currently on the market employ passive indexed strategies. ALAI’s active management could offer a multitude of potential benefits, depending on the macroeconomic backdrop.\n\nFinally, the fund remains deeply committed to its long-standing proprietary research process which focuses on identifying two key factors: High Unit Volume Growth and Positive Lifecycle Change. High Unit Volume Growth refers to companies that are swiftly growing in market dominance or demand. Meanwhile, Positive Lifecycle Change refers to companies that can benefit from other changing factors, such as new management, regulations, or innovations. This framework can help ALAI identity AI companies on the rise, and can potentially help the fund outpace a traditional indexed strategy.\n\nFactSet data shows that ALAI’s take on AI investing is attracting interest from advisors and investors alike. As of July 25, 2025, the fund has seen about $40 million in net flows over the past month.\n\n*For more news, information, and strategy, visit the* [***Artificial Intelligence Content Hub***](https://www.etftrends.com/artificial-intelligence-channel/)*.*\n\n---\n\n## Disclosure Information\n\n[Click here](https://www.alger.com/pages/Products.aspx?productCode=2494&utm_source=vettafi&utm_medium=page-link&utm_campaign=article-1) for more information about the Alger AI Enablers & Adopters ETF.\n\nThe views expressed are the views of Fred Alger Management, LLC (“FAM”) and its affiliates as of August 2025. These views are subject to change at any time and may not represent the views of all portfolio management teams. Views should not be interpreted as a guarantee of the future performance of the markets, any security or any funds managed by FAM. These views are not meant to provide investment advice and should not be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell securities. Holdings and sector allocations are subject to change. **Past performance is not indicative of future performance.**\n\n**Risk Disclosures**: Investing in the stock market involves risks, including the potential loss of principal. Growth stocks may be more volatile than other stocks as their prices tend to be higher in relation to their companies’ earnings and may be more sensitive to market, political, and economic developments. **Companies involved in, or exposed to, AI-related businesses may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel as they face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence, and many depend significantly on retaining and growing their consumer base.** These companies may be substantially exposed to the market and business risks of other industries or sectors, and may be adversely affected by negative developments impacting those companies, industries or sectors, as well as by loss or impairment of intellectual property rights or misappropriation of their technology. Companies that utilize AI could face reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and/or an adverse effect on business operations as content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications produce may be deficient, inaccurate, biased, misleading or incomplete, may lead to errors, and may be used in negligent or criminal ways. AI technology could face increasing regulatory scrutiny in the future, which may limit the development of this technology and impede the future growth.  AI companies, especially smaller companies, tend to be more volatile than companies that do not rely heavily on technology. A significant portion of assets will be concentrated in securities in related industries, and may be similarly affected by adverse developments and price movements in such industries. A significant portion of assets may be invested in securities of companies in related sectors, and may be similarly affected by economic, political, or market events and conditions and may be more vulnerable to unfavorable sector developments.  Investing in companies of  small and medium capitalizations involves the risk that such issuers may have limited product lines or financial resources, lack management depth, or have limited liquidity. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified fund” under federal securities laws because it can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified fund. Private placements are offerings of a company’s securities not registered with the SEC and not offered to the public, for which limited information may be available. Such investments are generally considered to be illiquid. Foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations, inefficient trading, political and economic instability, and increased volatility. ADRs and GDRs may be subject to  international trade, currency, political, regulatory and diplomatic risks. Active trading may increase transaction costs, brokerage commissions, and taxes, which can lower the return on investment. At times, cash may be a larger position in the portfolio and may underperform relative to equity securities.\n\nETF shares are based on market price rather than net asset value (“NAV”), as a result, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund may also incur brokerage commissions, as well as the cost of the bid/ask spread, when purchase or selling ETF shares. The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation and/or redemption process of the Fund. Any of these factors, among others, may lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. Thus, you may pay more (or less) than NAV when you buy shares of the Fund in the secondary market, and you may receive less (or more) than NAV when you sell those shares in the secondary market. The Manager cannot predict whether shares will trade above (premium), below (discount) or at NAV. The Fund may effect its creations and redemptions for cash, rather than for in-kind securities. Therefore, it may be required to sell portfolio securities and subsequently recognize gains on such sales that the Fund might not have recognized if it were to distribute portfolio securities in-kind. As such, investments in Fund shares may be less tax-efficient than an investment in an ETF that distributes portfolio securities entirely in-kind. Brokerage fees and taxes will be higher than if the Fund sold and redeemed shares in-kind. Certain shareholders, including other funds advised by the Manager or an affiliate of the Manager, may from time to time own a substantial amount of the shares of the Fund. Redemptions by large shareholders could have a significant negative impact on the Fund.\n\nAlger pays compensation to VettaFi to sell various strategies to prospective investors.\n\nThe following positions represented the noted percentages of ALAI assets as of June 30, 2025: NVIDIA Corporation: 15.05%; Microsoft Corporation: 10.67%.\n\n**Before investing, carefully consider a Fund’s investment objective, risks, charges, and expenses.

But the impact is likely to be transitory as new job opportunities created by the technology ultimately put people to work in other capacities, according to Goldman Sachs Research.\n\n“A recent pickup in AI adoption and reports of AI-related layoffs have raised concerns that AI will lead to widespread labor displacement,” Joseph Briggs, who co-leads the Global Economics team in Goldman Sachs Research, and economist Sarah Dong, write in a report. “While these trends could broaden as adoption increases, we remain skeptical that AI will lead to large employment reductions over the next decade.”\n\nTemporary unemployment caused by the adoption of labor-saving technologies typically increases the US jobless rate by 0.3 percentage point with every 1 percentage point gain in technology-driven productivity growth. However the impact is usually fleeting—such job displacement tends to disappear after two years, Briggs and Dong write.\n\n**How will AI impact labor productivity?**\n\nOur economists estimate that generative AI will raise the level of [labor productivity](/insights/macroeconomics) in the US and other developed markets by around 15% when fully adopted and incorporated into regular production. That would translate into a half-percentage-point rise in the unemployment rate above its trend during the AI transition period, though that impact could be higher if AI adoption is more frontloaded than they assume.\n\nAs part of their research, the team examined more than 800 occupations to assess whether AI productivity gains will translate into job displacement. The 6-7% estimate for job displacement from AI is the team’s baseline assumption, but they write that displacement rates could vary from 3% to 14% under different assumptions.\n\n**What could AI mean for unemployment?**\n\nThere are two ways in which AI could hypothetically lead to an increase in unemployment. The first is if AI capabilities advance to a point where human input becomes redundant for many types of production, leading to persistent structural unemployment.\n\nThis outcome is unlikely, according to [Goldman Sachs Research](/insights/goldman-sachs-research), because technology change tends to boost demand for workers in new occupations. That can take place either directly through new jobs that emerge from technological change or indirectly by triggering an overall boost in output and demand. Approximately 60% of US workers today are in occupations that didn’t exist in 1940, implying that more than 85% of employment growth since then has been from technology-driven job creation.\n\n“Predictions that technology will reduce the need for human labor have a long history but a poor track record,” Briggs and Dong write.\n\nHowever there could also be a period of higher unemployment while AI-displaced workers are looking for new jobs. “Frictional unemployment is not unique to AI and occurs during most periods of rapid technological change,” Briggs and Dong write. Historically, upheaval from technological innovation has proven to be temporary—after two years there is no noticeable impact.\n\n**Is AI already causing job losses?**\n\nRecent commentary by some public companies suggests the labor market is already experiencing effects related to AI. Executives from the technology and finance sectors say they are seeing efficiency gains from generative AI that are sufficient to slow their hiring, especially in operational and back-office capacities.\n\nThat said, AI adoption remains relatively low, especially among midsized and small enterprises. While adoption rates have accelerated recently, the vast majority of companies have not incorporated AI into regular workflows. In a recent US survey, only 9.3% of companies reported that they had used generative AI in production during the last two weeks.\n\nTo date, low adoption is limiting the overall labor-market impacts from AI, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our economists found no significant statistical correlation between AI exposure and a host of economic measures, including job growth, unemployment rates, job finding rates, layoff rates, growth in weekly hours, or average hourly earnings growth.\n\n**What industries are being affected by AI?**\n\nStill, there are early signs of disruption in specific industries. Employment growth in industries such as marketing consulting, graphic design, office administration, and telephone call centers has fallen below trend amid reports of reduced labor demand due to AI-related efficiency gains.\n\nIn addition, employment growth in technology-sector occupations such as computer systems design, software publishing, and web search portals has slowed sharply. Tech employment as a share of overall employment has decreased steadily since November 2022.\n\n“While some of the decline can be attributed to payback from over-hiring during the pandemic, tech’s employment share has now fallen below its (remarkably linear) pre-pandemic trend, a pattern probably related to AI automation,” Briggs and Dong write.\n\nSo far, younger tech workers appear to be disproportionately affected. Unemployment among 20- to 30-year-olds in tech-exposed occupations has risen by almost 3 percentage points since the start of 2025, notably higher than for their same-aged counterparts in other trades and for overall tech workers as well. This corroborates anecdotal reports that generative AI is contributing to hiring headwinds facing recent college graduates in technology.\n\nDespite compelling evidence of AI’s impact on hiring, the range of affected positions remains narrow. If current AI use cases were expanded across the economy, Goldman Sachs Research estimates that just 2.5% of US employment would be at risk of displacement.\n\n**Which jobs are most at risk for AI automation in the future?**\n\nBut what about tomorrow? To help assess the risk of AI-related job loss across industries in the future, our researchers looked at factors such as task repetitiveness, the consequences of errors from AI tools, the connections between tasks, and the value of AI-exposed tasks compared to prevailing wages.\n\nThey conclude that occupations at the highest risk of being displaced by AI in the coming years include computer programmers, accountants and auditors, legal and administrative assistants, customer service representatives, telemarketers, proofreaders and copy editors, and credit analysts. Those at the least risk of being displaced are air traffic controllers, chief executives, radiologists, pharmacists, residential advisors, photographers, and members of the clergy.\n\nStill, our researchers caution that it’s early days for AI adoption, and that the impact on jobs will largely depend on how employers ultimately put the technology to best use.\n\n“Until the AI adoption cycle has fully played out, the potential labor market disruption—including which jobs are likely to be displaced by generative AI—will remain an open question,” Briggs and Dong write.\n\nThis material is provided in conjunction with the associated video/audio content for convenience.  The content of this material may differ from the associated video/audio and Goldman Sachs is not responsible for any errors in the material.

While many employees are eager to harness AI to boost productivity, inconsistent policies and cultural hesitation are fueling secrecy around AI adoption at work.

And both of us know that employee hesitation is less about the tool itself and more about the fear behind it. AI in HR is no different. Many team members hear “artificial intelligence” and instantly worry about job loss, not job growth.\n\nThat is why it is so important for us to help them understand that AI is here to ***amplify their impact***, not to replace them. Just like Excel didn’t replace accountants but made them faster, smarter, and more strategic, AI is simply another tool in the HR toolkit. The challenge for HR leaders isn’t just learning AI themselves, it’s helping their teams see AI as an ally instead of a threat.\n\nAnd you have likely seen that reassurance alone won’t work. You can’t just say, “Don’t worry, your job is safe” and expect confidence to bloom. You need to show employees how AI can make their work easier, more engaging, and even more valued. That’s where thoughtful training, real examples, and yes, effective AI prompting (Paul is great at that 😉) come in.\n\nThe real win is teaching teams how AI directly improves their day-to-day work.\n\n## **Why HR Professionals Must Lead the AI Learning Curve**\n\n**1. HR is the culture driver**  \nIf AI adoption in HR feels like a top-down mandate instead of a collaborative shift, employees will resist. HR professionals need to model curiosity, experimentation, and transparency with AI. For example, showing how AI can help draft job descriptions in half the time frees staff to spend more time on human conversations, which is the part of HR no technology can replace.\n\n**2. HR is the bridge between leadership and employees**  \nLeaders may see AI as an efficiency tool, but employees may fear it as a job-cutting mechanism. HR can translate the business benefits into personal benefits, like using AI to prepare more personalized onboarding experiences or create tailored career development plans. This is how you turn a skeptical “why” into an enthusiastic “how soon?”\n\n**3. HR is responsible for capability building**  \nIf your team doesn’t learn how to use AI now, they risk falling behind on the very skills their roles will require in the near future. The sooner HR professionals integrate AI into everyday workflows—like summarizing meeting notes, creating learning modules, or analyzing engagement survey results—the sooner AI becomes just “part of the job” instead of “something scary and new.”\n\nAnd as Paul often points out, the rest of the organization is going to look to HR to train all employees on the use of AI, so if the HR team doesn’t have a good understanding of how they use AI, it will be difficult to explain it to others.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/374f78b6-635d-4614-9f83-39ea2ab08cad/Promptly_section_header_transparent.png?t=1704849028)\n\nAI adoption starts with you. Keep exploring how to write clear, structured, and purposeful prompts so you can show your team what’s possible—and maybe even surprise them with how much they’ll enjoy using it.\n\nPaul hears this all the time when he trains HR professionals on ways to improve their prompt techniques:\n\n## ***“I didn’t know AI could do that!”***\n\n### **Takeaways:**\n\nEmployee hesitation often comes from fear of replacement, not from dislike of the tool.\n\nHR must lead by example and actively demonstrate AI’s role as a helper, not a threat.\n\nThe real win is teaching teams how AI directly improves their day-to-day work.\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to get started, as that will just make it harder when your CEO knocks on your door and asks about your workforce plan that integrates AI with the humans on the team. If that does happen, reach out to Paul and he will help you craft a valuable response.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **Perpeta Paul Pointer:**  When employees push back on AI, don’t rush into a tech tutorial.

[**Tailored AI solutions**](https://centelli.com/) offer a clear roadmap, helping overcome adoption barriers as well.\n\n![AI Hesitancy to AI Adoption - Practical Steps](https://centelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AI-Hesitancy-to-AI-Adoption-Key-Steps.png)\n![AI Hesitancy to AI Adoption - Practical Steps]()\n![AI Hesitancy to AI Adoption - Practical Steps]()\n\n[Reach out to us](mailto:info@centelli.com) if you’ve any questions or want detailed info about Centelli’s custom Automation and AI solutions & services.\n\n## **Finally: Fascinating Facts About Business AI Hesitancy & Adoption**\n\nBy 2025, nearly 78% of companies worldwide will have adopted AI, with most using it across an average of three different business functions, according to a [report.](https://www.hostinger.com/in/tutorials/how-many-companies-use-ai#:~:text=As%20of%202025%2C%2078%25%20of,noticeable%20increase%20since%20early%202024.)\n\n**However, there is a contrasting side — AI hesitancy and slower adoption even now. Surprisingly, in advanced nations as well!**\n\nFurthermore, it found that AI users are more likely to work in IT, banking, finance, accounting, real estate, or insurance, and in roles that involve data processing.\n\nSurely, we can argue that compliance and cybersecurity sectors are deliberately slower to adopt AI due to their unique challenges. However, **experts warn that AI hesitancy in businesses can increase their risk of falling behind**.\n\nRegarding ‘maturity,’ the report clarifies that it means AI is fully integrated into workflows and delivers substantial business outcomes.\n\n### Popular Post\n\n![](https://centelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AI-in-Financial-Risk-Management.png)\n\n#### AI in Financial Risk Management: Robust Control & Smarter Decisions\n\n![](https://centelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blog-Main-Sage-Accounting-Software-min-e1722586090701.jpg)\n\n#### Sage Accounting Software – Benefits & Features (A Quick Review)\n\n![](https://centelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-Banner-bookkeeping-1568x882.jpg)\n\n#### Why Bookkeeping For Small Business is Vital (Top 10 Reasons)\n\n#### Share with your community!\n\n![](/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/linkedin-1-1-4.png)\n![](/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/twitter-1-1.png)\n\n### Categories\n\n### Related Articles\n\n![](https://centelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Centelli-JTHC-Blog-Hero-Image.png)\n\n##### 07-Aug-2025\n\n#### Centelli’s Digital Workers in Hospitality Automation: Takeaways from the JHTC Case Study\n\n![](https://centelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Recruitment-Automation-Blog-Feature-Image.png)\n\n##### 24-Jul-2025\n\n#### Recruitment Process Automation: How to Address Hiring Bias & Build Fairness\n\n![](https://centelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Blog-Feature-Image-Data-Management-with-Digital-Worker.png)\n\n##### 07-Jul-2025\n\n#### How Digital Workers Deliver Smarter, Scalable Data Management Automation\n\n#### United Kingdom\n\n27 Clements Lane,   \nLondon, EC4N 7AE\n\nEmail: [info@Centelli.com](mailto:info@centelli.com?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20learn%20about%20Digital%20Workers%20-%20Please%20contact%20me)\n\n#### United States\n\n3225 Cumberland Blvd SE  \nSuite 100\n\nEmail: [info@Centelli.com](mailto:info@centelli.com?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20learn%20about%20Digital%20Workers%20-%20Please%20contact%20me)\n\n#### India\n\nPlot No. 16, 8th Floor\nSector 22,  \n IT Park\nPanchkula, Haryana  \nIndia 134109\n\nEmail: [info@Centelli.com](mailto:info@centelli.com)\n\n#### Quick Links\n\n##### Reach Us on Socials\n\n![](/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/linkedin.png)\n![](/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Group-514609473.svg)\n![](/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/YOUTUBE.png)\n\n© Copyright 2024 – Centelli.

You announce it in a team meeting. You offer support. But what you get back is not excitement. It’s hesitation. Confusion. Discomfort. Some people opt out quietly. Others resist more directly. Some just shut down.\n\nThat reaction isn’t a tech issue. It’s not a capability issue either. It’s what we’re now calling [**AI Adoption Anxiety**](https://www.drmichellerozen.com/articles/driving-change/managing-resistance-to-ai-adoption/)—and it’s one of the biggest unspoken barriers to change in today’s workplace.\n\nI surveyed 5,000 professionals across industries and roles to understand how people are truly responding to AI implementation. Seventy-four percent reported feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or emotionally resistant. More than 60 percent worried they would become irrelevant or less valuable in the face of this change. And perhaps most importantly, 80 percent said they had received little to no emotional support from leadership during the transition.\n\nThat’s a problem. And as leaders, it’s our responsibility to fix it.\n\n## **Why AI Adoption Anxiety Is Spreading—and What It Looks Like**\n\nAccording to EY recent Work Reimagined Survey, 72 percent of employees globally say they are not confident in their ability to adapt to AI. Microsoft’s most recent Work Trend Index found that while 79 percent of leaders see AI as critical to productivity, [**more than half of employees feel uncertain**](https://www.drmichellerozen.com/articles/driving-change/why-teams-struggle-to-adapt-to-ai/) about how to use it without clear direction.\n\nWhat we’re seeing is a widening gap between technological ambition and emotional readiness.\n\nThis kind of anxiety doesn’t always announce itself. It shows up in subtle ways. A top performer becomes quiet in meetings. A reliable team member misses deadlines for the first time. Entire departments delay adoption without explanation. What looks like resistance is often fear. What looks like apathy is often anxiety.\n\nAnd here’s what matters most: anxiety multiplies in silence.\n\nIf you, as a leader, are not addressing it directly and early, it will spread. It will erode morale. It will slow execution. And it will make every future change more difficult.\n\n## **The Hidden Cost of Unspoken AI Adoption Anxiety**\n\nUnchecked AI anxiety has very real consequences. Organizations experiencing high emotional resistance during tech rollouts report significantly lower tool adoption, longer implementation cycles, and greater team fragmentation. McKinsey reports that companies with [**strong emotional intelligence**](https://www.drmichellerozen.com/emotional-intelligence/emotionally-intelligent-leadership/) embedded in their leadership adopt change 40 percent faster and see higher long-term engagement.\n\nLet me be clear. This is not about talking people into liking AI. This is about helping people feel safe enough to adapt to it. Emotional safety drives speed. Emotional alignment drives results.\n\nIf you’re moving fast but losing your people emotionally, you’re not leading change. You’re managing fallout.\n\n## **Five Ways Emotionally Intelligent Leaders Reduce AI Anxiety**\n\nHere’s how I help leadership teams address this head-on. These five practices are grounded in the five pillars of [**emotional intelligence**](https://www.drmichellerozen.com/emotional-intelligence/) and are built for today’s pace of change.\n\n### **1. Stop Assuming Silence Means Comfort**\n\nIf no one is raising concerns, don’t assume everyone’s on board. In emotionally strained environments, silence usually means fear, not alignment.\n\nAsk, don’t guess. I teach leaders to pause after every AI announcement and ask two simple questions:\n\nYou’ll be surprised what surfaces when you create space for it.\n\n### **2. Make Emotional Check-ins a Leadership Habit**\n\nSelf-awareness is not optional during transformation. Your tone, presence, and emotional state set the baseline for the entire team.\n\nI use a tool I call The Mirror Moment. At the end of every day, ask yourself:\n\nWhat you model emotionally becomes your team’s baseline.\n\n### **3. Break Change into Wins, Not Waves**\n\nMost anxiety comes from overwhelm. Leaders often present transformation as one massive leap. That’s when fear kicks in. Instead, present change in stages. Make each step visible. [**Celebrate small wins**](https://www.drmichellerozen.com/articles/decision-making-skills/winning-habits-how-to-build-habits-that-set-you-up-for-success/).\n\nI call this the Bite-Size Boost. You don’t need to train your team on the entire platform in a day. You need to help them succeed at one new action. Success builds confidence. Confidence reduces anxiety.\n\n### **4. Say What They’re Afraid to Say**\n\nThe biggest mistake I see leaders make? Pretending anxiety isn’t happening. If you’re not addressing the fear, you’re endorsing the silence.\n\nStart your next team meeting like this:  \n“Some of us are excited about this. Some of us are nervous. Both are normal reactions. Let’s talk about what we need in order to move forward.”\n\nThat sentence alone creates psychological safety. And when people feel safe, they stop resisting and start engaging.\n\n### **5. Don’t Just Train. Co-Create.**\n\nTraining without trust will always fall short. I teach leaders to invite their teams into the process. Instead of saying, “Here’s the new tool, learn it,” say:  \n“Let’s figure out the best way to use this tool for how we already work.”\n\nCo-creation reduces fear. It makes your team feel like they still matter—which is exactly what anxiety takes away.\n\n## **Leadership in the Age of Emotion and Uncertainty**\n\nAI is not going away. But your best people might—if you don’t lead this well.\n\nThe leaders who will win this decade are not the ones who push change the fastest. They are the ones who understand people the best. Emotional intelligence is no longer optional. It is the multiplier for every technical decision you make.\n\nAI anxiety is real. It is rising. And it is absolutely manageable.\n\nBut only if we lead with clarity, curiosity, and the courage to say what others won’t. Let’s stop managing tools and start leading humans. That’s how we calm the chaos—and build organizations that are ready for whatever comes next.\n\n### MORE AMAZING CONTENT FOR YOU\n\n![25 Must-Ask AI questions](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20450'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![25 Must-Ask AI questions](//i0.wp.com/drmichellerozen.com/wp-content/uploads/25-Must-Ask-AI-questions1-1024x576.png)\n\n###### 25 Essential Questions Every Leader Must Ask to Help Your Team Adapt to AI Successfully\n\nWhy Helping Your Team Adapt to AI Matters More Than You Think This year, I surveyed 5,000 professionals across industries...\n\n![Culture of adaptability](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20450'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![Culture of adaptability](//i0.wp.com/drmichellerozen.com/wp-content/uploads/culture-of-adaptability-1024x576.jpg)\n\n###### Tips for Building a Culture of Adaptability at Work\n\nWhy Is Adaptability Important in the Workplace?

BigID was a finalist in the '[Best Data-driven SaaS Innovation](https://www.cloud-awards.com/software-as-a-service-awards/best-data-driven-saas-innovation)' category at [The 2025 SaaS Awards](https://www.cloud-awards.com/software-as-a-service-awards/), and a finalist in the '[Best Cloud Data Management Solution](https://www.cloud-awards.com/cloud-computing-awards/best-cloud-data-management-solution/)' category at [The 2024/25 Cloud Awards](https://www.cloud-awards.com/cloud-computing-awards/).*\n\n**AI is no longer a technology on the horizon.**\n\nIt's already deeply embedded in our everyday life, from AI helping us improve our emails to Agentic AI being the first responder that customers reach out to for help. The latest report from tech analyst Mary Meeker paints a vivid picture of just how far and fast the AI boom has gone.\n\nBut behind the headlines and the optimism lies an uncomfortable truth: most organizations are dangerously unprepared for the very real risks that come with this wave of innovation.\n\nMeeker's 2025 trends report shows AI adoption is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. ChatGPT reached 800 million users by April 2025 and was handling over 365 billion searches annually. The cost to run and deploy AI is plummeting. Companies across the globe are racing to build, integrate, and monetize AI solutions, fueled by increased investment and a flood of new tools.\n\nYet this gold rush is outpacing many companies' ability to secure what they're building. They are effectively adding rocket fuel to their operations without double-checking if the safety systems can handle the speed.\n\n#### **AI is accessible, but often unmanaged**\n\nAs Meeker points out, AI is becoming cheaper and more commoditized. Open-source models and API-based services make it easy for developers and teams to experiment with generative AI on their own. While accessibility to AI spurs on innovation, it also means AI is often being used without centralized oversight or clear guidelines.\n\nThat's where things get risky.\n\nAccording to a recent [AI Risk & Readiness survey](http://home.bigid.com/download-ai-risk-report) of security and data leaders, only 6% of organizations say they have a mature AI security strategy in place. Nearly half have no AI-specific controls. And most worryingly, 64% report that they don't have full visibility into where or how AI is being used within their organization.\n\nWhile this new accessibility accelerates creativity, it also means that AI is often being deployed with little or no oversight. Many organizations still lack clear guidelines for how AI tools should be used, what data they can process, or who can access what. The result is an ever-expanding web of AI tools running in the shadows.\n\nIn short: AI is everywhere, but governance is missing.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20465'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://www.cloud-awards.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AdobeStock_1516601568-1200x465.jpeg)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20465'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://www.cloud-awards.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AdobeStock_1516601568-1200x465.jpeg)\n\n#### **The rise of shadow AI**\n\nYou might remember the early days of shadow IT, when employees brought in their own devices and apps to get work done faster. Security teams spent years trying to rein it in. Now, the same pattern is repeating itself with AI.\n\nThis gap is giving rise to what some are calling \"Shadow AI,\" aka the use of AI tools and models without IT or security approval. Just like shadow IT before it, Shadow AI introduces serious vulnerabilities. Employees may use generative AI to analyze sensitive data, generate code, or create customer-facing content without knowing where the data goes or how it's stored.\n\nWhen AI systems operate outside the lines, it becomes nearly impossible for organizations to ensure compliance, protect data, or even detect errors.\n\nIn the AI risk and readiness survey mentioned previously, nearly 70% of organizations listed AI-powered data leaks as their top concern. And yet most still lack real-time monitoring for AI-related risks.\n\nIf you don't know where AI lives in your business, you can't secure it. You can't ensure compliance. You can't catch errors before they cause harm. And you certainly can't promise customers their data is safe.\n\n#### **Compliance is struggling to keep up**\n\nAlongside the security risks is another mounting challenge: regulation.\n\nGovernments around the world are moving quickly to create guardrails for AI. The EU AI Act has already passed. U.S. states like California are drafting their own frameworks. And industry-specific regulations in healthcare, finance, and beyond are starting to address AI explicitly.\n\nBut most enterprises aren't ready. The same survey found that 55% of organizations are unprepared to meet current or upcoming AI compliance requirements. That puts them at risk of penalties, lawsuits, and reputational damage.\n\nEven sectors that have traditionally been more risk-aware are struggling. Only 38% of financial institutions surveyed had AI-specific data protection strategies. In healthcare, over half said that complying with AI regulations was a major hurdle. And nearly half of retailers had no visibility into how AI tools interact with customer data.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://www.cloud-awards.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AdobeStock_1022436370-1200x800.jpeg)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](https://www.cloud-awards.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AdobeStock_1022436370-1200x800.jpeg)\n\n#### **Building AI governance into the foundation**\n\nMeeker's report makes it clear that AI will continue to reshape industries across the board. But without a parallel investment in governance, companies may end up building innovation on a shaky foundation. What's needed isn't a slowdown but smarter adoption.\n\nThat starts with visibility. You can't manage what you can't see. Organizations need clear inventories of what AI tools they're using, where they live, and who has access to them.\n\nNext comes policy. Companies should develop AI usage guidelines that spell out how AI can and can't be used, what data it can touch, and who is responsible for monitoring its outputs. These policies shouldn't live in a PDF that gets filed away. They need to be embedded into everyday workflows and backed up with training.\n\nReal-time risk monitoring is another must-have. Just as companies have invested in tools to monitor their cloud and endpoint security, they now need controls that detect unusual AI activity, flag data exfiltration attempts, and help respond to incidents quickly.\n\nCompanies should also align their AI security and compliance strategies with evolving regulations through a comprehensive AI TRiSM (Trust, Risk, and Security Management) approach\n\nCrucially, AI security and compliance shouldn't live in silos. Governance has to be cross-functional, connecting legal, data, IT, and business teams. And it should be adaptable. Regulations are changing fast. So are the tools. The governance frameworks need to keep up.\n\n#### **The bottom line**\n\nMary Meeker's report captures the scale of the opportunity. AI is transforming how we work, communicate, and build. But the risks aren't keeping pace with the rewards. Most organizations don't have the visibility, controls, or strategies to manage the downside of this transformation.\n\nIt's not too late to course-correct. But it requires shifting the focus from just what AI can do, to how we use it responsibly.\n\nThe companies that get this right won't just avoid risk. They'll be the ones leading the way forward.\n\n## About the Author: [Alexis

This creates \"AI Adoption Anxiety,\" a widening gap between a company's technological ambitions and its team's emotional readiness <a href=\"https://www.drmichellerozen.com/articles/driving-change/ai-anxiety-at-work/\">Source</a>. To bridge this, leaders must foster a culture of transparency, framing AI as a supportive co-worker, not a replacement. This involves clear usage guidelines, robust training, and open dialogue to address fears, thereby mitigating significant security risks and fostering trust.</p>\n\n<h2>Taming Shadow AI in SMBs</h2>\n<p>The productivity promise of AI is tempting, but for Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs), it comes with a hidden threat: Shadow AI. This refers to employees using AI applications and tools without company knowledge or approval. While often well-intentioned to improve efficiency, this practice opens the door to significant business risks.</p>\n<p>The scale of the issue is staggering, with studies indicating as many as 80% of SMB workers engage in Shadow AI <a href=\"https://pallasadvisory.com/2025/08/19/shadow-ai-employees-using-ai-without-permission/\">Source</a>. When employees input sensitive company data—such as client information, financial records, or proprietary code—into unvetted public AI models, they risk data security breaches, exposing confidential information <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gervanhees_cybersecurity-smbs-ai-activity-7360567301215055872-8Xb5\">Source</a>, and compliance violations, which can result in severe financial penalties.</p>\n<p>Ignoring Shadow AI is not a viable strategy. SMBs must balance innovation with governance, starting with a clear and practical AI usage policy. Rather than an outright ban, which is often ineffective, policies should guide employees toward safe practices. Experts recommend establishing clear accountability by designating a specific person or team to oversee all AI implementation and use <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shadow-ai-balancing-innovation-risk-workplace-alex-velinov-1ps9e\">Source</a>. This AI lead can vet and approve secure, high-impact tools, reducing the incentive for unauthorized alternatives and protecting valuable assets.</p>\n\n<h3>Sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.datapro.news/p/chatgpt-and-copilot-lead-the-charge-an-investigation-into-the-generational-and-professional-divide-i\">datapro.news – ChatGPT and Copilot Lead the Charge: An Investigation into the Generational and Professional Divide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drmichellerozen.com/articles/driving-change/ai-anxiety-at-work/\">Dr. Michelle Rozen – AI Adoption Anxiety at Work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-will-ai-affect-the-global-workforce\">Goldman Sachs – How will AI affect the global workforce?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-agents-statistics\">Index.dev – AI Agents Statistics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shadow-ai-balancing-innovation-risk-workplace-alex-velinov-1ps9e\">LinkedIn – Alex Velinov: Shadow AI: Balancing Innovation and Risk in the Workplace</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gervanhees_cybersecurity-smbs-ai-activity-7360567301215055872-8Xb5\">LinkedIn – Gervan Hees: Cybersecurity for SMBs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pallasadvisory.com/2025/08/19/shadow-ai-employees-using-ai-without-permission/\">Pallas Advisory – Shadow AI: Employees Using AI Without Permission</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://promptlyhr.com/p/how-to-turn-ai-skeptics-into-ai-supporters\">Promptly HR – How to Turn AI Skeptics into AI Supporters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://securitytoday.com/articles/2025/08/18/survey-nearly-half-of-employees-hide-workplace-ai-use.aspx?admgarea=ht.homeland\">Security Today – Survey: Nearly Half of Employees Hide Workplace AI Use</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The widespread integration of AI across enterprises presents both immense opportunities and complex challenges. Bridging the generational and professional divides in AI adoption, addressing the hidden use of AI by employees, and proactively managing Shadow AI are crucial for fostering a secure, efficient, and innovative workplace. By prioritizing clear governance, transparent communication, and targeted education, organizations can unlock AI's full potential while mitigating its inherent risks, ensuring a seamless and secure transition into an AI-powered future.</p>"
